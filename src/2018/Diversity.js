        React Boston believes that diversity is an important part of creating a
        welcoming, inclusive, and innovative tech community.

      <P>
        For React Boston 2018, we've allocated a set of diversity tickets to be
        offered at no cost to members of underrepresented groups in tech. We
        will also prioritize CFP submissions from speakers who indicate they are
        part of an underrepresented group in tech.
      </P>
      <P>
        We are committed to ensuring that React Boston is accessible for all
        attendees. For questions about accessibility or to request an
        accommodation, please reach out to{' '}
